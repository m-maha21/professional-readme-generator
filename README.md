# Professional README Generator

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to create a tool that simplifies the process of generating high-quality README files for GitHub projects. As a developer, I understand the importance of having a well-structured README to provide users and potential contributors with essential information about the project.
Through building this project, I gained experience in working with Node.js, the inquirer package for user input, and generating Markdown content dynamically. I learned how to structure a command-line application, handle user input, and generate formatted text output. Additionally, I developed a deeper understanding of the importance of project documentation and the value of automation in improving developer productivity.
